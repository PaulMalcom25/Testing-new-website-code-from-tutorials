This is my first website. I'mtrying to test out fonts but things
        are not turning out as expected.

  <blockquote><p>This is me trying out the new blockquote element i 
      just learned today morning. So basically, it defines a section within the document that was quoted from another source. Cool right! So I'm gonna take it for a test run. Einstein once said," Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results". Honestly speaking he's quite right. No wonder he the main figure used currently to depict what it means to be genius. Of course what put him on the map was the discovery of the mass-energy relation potreyed by the formula E=mcsquared.

        <h2>
            FIFA 2021 <strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>
        </h2>
        <P>
            Hello everybody. I'm back again with some interesting information about the game everyone is anticipating for this November. That's right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_FIFA_Club_World_Cup">FIFA 2021</a>. I really don'tknow for sure if they are gonna call it that because theymay end up changing the naming style as it becoming awkward. And if they do what do you think they will most likely call it. Give me your thoughts in the comments section.
        </P>
        <p>
            Now getting backto what brought us here today the FIFA 2021 <em>release date</em>. Chatter has been going around that the tech company EA has had a few glitches and are pushing up the release date to the beginning of January. All this is an effort to create more time to deal withthe glitch. No one knows for sure but the anticipated release date is 3rd December. I konw it is too far but most can just pre-order so you will get it on the exact day and that's a silver lining. Don't get angry at me people, just trying to remain positive.

        House of encounter: In the old testament, Moses used to call upon the Israelites so as to worship and seek God.
        4.	Ministry and Church
       1st: If we talk of a church as a building, it means that ministry comes first because a person cannot do a church when God works are not reviewed in him or her.
       2nd: If we talk of a church as a person, it means that church comes first before the ministry because you have to first have church inside you so as God to manifest his works unto you.5.
